# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security
By the end of this course, I developed a greater understanding of network architecture, operations, intrusion tactics, common types of network vulnerabilities and attacks, and how to secure networks. I also was introduced to common network protocols, firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and system hardening practices. 
In this course, I was also able to Define types of networks, Explain how data is sent and received over a network, Recognize common network protocols, Compare and contrast local networks to cloud computing and Explain how to secure a network against intrusion tactics.

## Modules
### Module 1: Network architecture
Introduction to network security and explaining how it relates to ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. learning about network architecture and mechanisms to secure a network.

### Module 2: Network operations
Exploring network protocols and how network communication can introduce vulnerabilities. In addition, you'll learn about common security measures, like firewalls, that help network operations remain safe and reliable.

### Module 3: Secure against network intrusions
You will understand types of network attacks and techniques used to secure compromised network systems and devices. You'll explore the many ways that malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and how cybersecurity professionals identify and close potential loopholes.

### Module 4: Security hardening
You will become familiar with network hardening practices that strengthen network systems. You'll learn how security hardening helps defend against malicious actors and intrusion methods. You'll also learn how to use security hardening to address the unique security challenges posed by cloud infrastructures.
